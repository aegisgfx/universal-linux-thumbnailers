Purpose: “Add thumbnail support for non deb installs of Blender, GIMP, Krita, and PSD files on Linux.”

Specifically snap Blender, flatpak Gimp and Krita since these installs do not seem to generate thumbnails natively on Ubuntu/Mint/Debian

Requirements: Snap or Flatpak installed apps, ImageMagick

Quick install instructions, e.g., copy .thumbnailer files to ~/.local/share/thumbnailers/.

Optional: instructions to refresh thumbnails, e.g., rm -r ~/.cache/thumbnails/* && nemo -q.
